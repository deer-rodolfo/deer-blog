    <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
    <p>
      Olá! My name is Rodolfo, I am Portuguese and I was born in a small island
      named Pico, in the middle of the Atlantic. I currently live in Leipzig,
      Germany.

    <p>
      My first passion in tech was aircrafts however, destiny brought me to work
      in the web as a front-end developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love reading José Saramago, I am caught up listening to Jacob Collier
      and every day I believe more in the power of our inner energy.
